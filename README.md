## Official Result

On the PAN 2026 test set, our best configuration (`large-rank`) scored:

| Metric | Score |
|---|---|
| ROC-AUC | **0.891** |
| C@1 | 0.853 |
| F1 | 0.902 |
| F0.5u | 0.899 |
| **Mean (ranking metric)** | **0.887 — rank 7** |

On the PAN 2025 backward-compatibility test set the same configuration scored **0.979**. We submitted 11 software configurations to TIRA; they share the same trained base models and differ only in ensemble composition (which classifiers are included, stacker vs. weighted-average fusion, isotonic calibration on/off, LightGBM seed-bag size, and the abstention margin).

## Approach

A calibrated ensemble of three complementary classifiers combined by learned stacking:

- **DeBERTa-v2** — fine-tuned, exported to ONNX with INT8 dynamic quantization for CPU inference.
- **Multi-seed LightGBM** — over 44 domain-portable stylometric features, concatenated with truncated-SVD projections of character (3–6) and word (1–2) n-gram TF-IDF, plus GPT-2 perplexity features.
- **Calibrated linear SVM** — Platt-scaled, over raw sparse character/word n-gram TF-IDF.

Component probabilities are combined via a logistic-regression stacker with interaction features (max, min, std, range), followed by isotonic-regression calibration; borderline predictions within a narrow margin of 0.5 abstain.

The 44 features are deliberately **domain-portable**. That choice came from our companion Reasoning Trajectory Detection analysis, where generator- and topic-specific features died under domain shift (0% fire rate out-of-domain) while vocabulary fingerprints and compression measures survived — so every feature here was selected for support overlap across genres, not for training-set effect size.

### Feature groups (44)

| Group | Count | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| Document structure | 7 | word/char/sentence/paragraph counts |
| Vocabulary richness | 8 | type-token ratio, hapax ratio, Yule's K, Heaps' exponent, MATTR |
| Sentence structure | 6 | mean length, length CV, sentence-start diversity |
| Readability | 4 | Flesch-Kincaid, Coleman-Liau, avg. syllables |
| Compression/entropy | 4 | zlib ratio, char entropy, repetition ratio |
| Style markers | 9 | punctuation ratio, quote density, contraction ratio |
| Discourse | 4 | transition diversity, connective formality |
| Distributional | 2 | burstiness, intrinsic dimensionality |
| Perplexity (GPT-2) | 4 | log-perplexity, burstiness, rank-1 accuracy, binoculars ratio |

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install -e .
python download_onnx.py            # fetch/convert the quantized DeBERTa ONNX model
python train.py                    # train LightGBM + SVM, fit the stacker + calibrator
python calibrate_ensemble.py       # isotonic calibration of the fused score
python main.py -i input/ -o output/  # predict (writes probabilities)
```

Docker (TIRA):

```bash
docker build -t voight-kampff-clef2026 .
docker run --rm -v /input:/input -v /output:/output voight-kampff-clef2026 -i /input -o /output
```
